For the second year class Autonomy by design we made what amounts to a simulation of the spread of a virus (we used the corona virus for reference). 

The code for this simulation is in the Group folder. 
The world is created in Infect_Model.py and agent behaviour can be found in Infect_Agents.py. 
Because of time constraints and changes to the assignment the repo contains a lot of duct taped together parts. Not our best work.
